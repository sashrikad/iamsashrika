If you are someone that plays video games and LOVES coding, then you've come to the right place! As part of my summer wishlist in 2021, I wanted to create an old fashioned video game on the Wio Terminal that could be portable so that I could share this project with my peers in class. 

## Time Limit

However, this is not the kind of game that you can go forever without a time limit. This is a time-bound game of 1 minute (or at least that is how I programmed it to be) and once the time's up, it will bring you to the game over page and will display the points you earned in that round. Then if you want to continue playing, you have to wait 5 seconds and then a new game will start automatically.

## Shooter Movement & Target Scoring

In this game, you have a shooter that you can move with the 5 way button; left to right, along with pushing the upper part of the button, you can shoot your target that will constantly keep moving along screen. The target will move swiftly, so you have to keep your eyes peeled! By shooting the target, you can get points and will be tracked in a corner of the LCD screen. The way to score points in this game is to align your shooter with the target and then shoot it as fast as you can!
