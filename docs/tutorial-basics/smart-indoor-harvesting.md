## Motivation

I had participated in the 2021 do-your-bit contest where I prototyped an indoor plant harvesting system using Micro:bit. Since then, I was asking my dad how I could enhance my project so that I can control certain things in a smarter way.

So here are some of the ways my dad told me I could improve:
- In-built display
- In-built wifi
- Rich community support
- Easy intagration with Blynk

Basically all you need to get started with cloud connected IoT solution. For more information about Wio Terminal, visit [this link](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-p-4509.html)
