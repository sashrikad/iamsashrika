I made this cute 3D printed box with Wio terminal and NeoPixel ring. I wanted to give a tech gadget to my mother on this year Mother's day and had came up with this idea. I can share pictures and messages to the box from anywhere around the world. When the box receives any picture, the ring turns pink and buzz to notify my mother.
